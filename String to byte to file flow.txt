The input user text is encoded to (utf-8) byte code.
it is then used as arguments for encryption.
The bytes in ram are then decoded from (utf-8) after encryption.


To undo this, 
turn the file rawtext back into byte code (utf-8)
then use the decrypt function, and store the literals as temporary strings
